# WebGPU-native

This is an experimental [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/community/gpu/) implementation as a native static library. It's written in Rust and is based on [gfx-hal](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx) and [satellite](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx-memory) libraries. The corresponding WebIDL specification can be found at [gpuweb project](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/master/design/sketch.webidl).
